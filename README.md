# Monitor overdue of Camunda User Tasks

# Description

Simple monitoring example for overdue of camunda user tasks.

With every active user task a camunda job is persisted which is triggered if due date of user task is reached and it isnâ€™t completed or deleted. If job is triggered, a custom job handler is called which delegates to an escalation service. A specific escalation service implementation creates an incident of type 'overdue' in database which is associated to overdue user task. With a spring actuator endpoint these incidents are consumable for different monitoring applications.
